Specifically, we modify the MelGAN (Kumar et al., 2019) architecture to achieve better performance in Arabic speech generation, exploring multiple additional datasets and architectural choices, which involved extra discriminators designed to exploit high-frequency similarities between languages. In our evaluation, we used subjective human evaluation, MOS-Mean Opinion Score, and a novel\u00a0\u2026",

However, existing systems rely on skillful bilingual speakers to build a CS mix-lingual data set with a high Language-Mix-Ratio (LMR), while simply mixing monolingual data sets results in accent problems.
